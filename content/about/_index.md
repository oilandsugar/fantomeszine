  <em>Fantômes is a yearly collaborative ghost story zine, bringing together
  story-telling, poetry, folklore, illustration and photography in a small
  hand-bound publication. It is a place to explore personal and
  collective ghosts, lend them a voice through summoning rituals, raw
  poetry or scribbled drawings and get familiar with their haunting
  presence.</em>

    “It’s hard to walk with ghosts on your shoulders, but when you learn
    to listen to what they’re saying, you realize that they’re telling
    the story of who you are.”
